XA
===
XA for Linear and Mixed Integer Programming
-------------------------------------------
The XA solver is a :doc:`Linear Programming (LP) <../math-program/linear-programming>` and :doc:`Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) <../math-program/mixed-integer-programming>` solver. For solving LP problems you can choose between the simplex algorithm and the (efficient) barrier algorithm. The MIP solver can only use the simplex algorithm. A detailed list of all features supported by XA can be found on our :doc:`Solvers <solvers>` page.
