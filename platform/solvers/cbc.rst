CBC
=======

CBC Solver for Linear and Mixed Integer Programming
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The CBC solver is an open source :doc:`Linear Programming (LP) <../math-program/linear-programming>` and :doc:`Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) <../math-program/mixed-integer-programming>` solver. For solving LP problems you can choose between the primal and dual simplex algorithm. The MIP solver can use both algorithms. A detailed list of all features supported by CBC can be found here.
