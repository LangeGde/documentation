Other Mathematical Programming Types
========================================
Besides the mathematical programming types LP, MIP, NLP, MINLP and CP, AIMMS supports the following model types:

* Quadratic Programming (QP)
* Mixed Integer Quadratic Programming (MIQP)
* Quadratic Constrained Programming (QCP)
* Mixed Integer Quadratic Constrained Programming (MIQCP)
* Mixed Complementarity Programming (MCP)
* Mathematical Program with Complementarity Constraints (MPCC)

For a full description of the mixed complementarity programming support in AIMMS see Chapter 23 in the :doc:`Language Reference <../../aimms_ref>`.
