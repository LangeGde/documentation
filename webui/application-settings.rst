There are some settings that not only apply to a specific widget or page, but to the WebUI application as a whole. 
These settings can be accessed through the Application Settings menu, which you can open by clicking on the |applicationsettings-icon| icon:



Use Classic Theme
-----------------

From AIMMS 4.59 onwards, the look and feel of the WebUI has been upgraded to a more modern look and a consistent styling. However, for app developers who need more time to make sure their customized application looks as required with this new theme, the WebUI will offer you the choice which theme you want to use. More specifically: if you open an entirely new WebUI application, you automatically get the new look and feel (because there cannot be any backward compatibility issues in that scenario). If you open an already existing WebUI, however, you are offered the choice to try the new theme or to keep the old one for the time being. Should you want to toggle between the two, after having made this choice, we offer the 'Use Classic Theme' option in the 'Miscellaneous' tab. Simply set the switch to 'on' for the old theme, or to 'off' for the new theme.
