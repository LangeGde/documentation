Widget Types
============

There are many types of widgets that you can add to your WebUI pages. 
Some examples of widget types are: table, bar chart, line chart, button, selectionbox. 
You can see a complete list of available widget types by `adding a new widget <widget-general.html#add-a-widget>`_. 
The types are listed in the *Type* selectionbox in the *Add Widget Wizard*.

Most widget types are easy to add/use, but some of them benefit from some further explanation.
