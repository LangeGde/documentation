This section describes various tasks related to WebUI grid pages.

.. important::

	Grid pages are available from AIMMS software version 4.75.

Grid pages introduce a novel concept of visualization based on page layouts. When a layout is applied to a grid page, the page is divided in a number of rectangular areas which will always preserve their relative size and position on the page, even when the entire browser window is being resized. Each widget of a grid page must be assigned to one of the areas defined by the page layout. 

This way of organizing a page and the widgets on the page is supported by appropriate fuctionalities in the Page Manager. When opening the Page Manager two tabs are now available: the App tab and the Page tab. The App tab shows a list of all the pages in the application:

    :align: center

The actions for adding, renaming, moving, changing the visibility, and deleting a grid page in the Page Manager are the same as for a classic page. In particular, adding a new grid page can be done by selecting the grid icon in the page create options:

    :align: center

Once a page has been selected in the App tab, the Page tab shows more details about the particular page:

    :align: center
	
The upper part of the Page tab allows the user to select a certain layout for the page either as one of the Standard layouts or as a Custom layout. First we are going to discuss options for applying Standard layouts. Afterwards, we will also discuss relevant topics for using Custom layouts. 

As shown in the last picture above, a particular case of a standard layout is "Layout: classic". When this layout is applied to a grid page, then there are no areas defined end the widgets are placed on the page in the same way as done
