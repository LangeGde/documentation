	Grid pages are available from AIMMS software version 4.75.

Grid pages introduce a new concept of visualization based on page layouts. When a layout is applied to a grid page, the page is divided in a number of rectangular areas which will always preserve their relative size and position on the page, even when the entire browser window is being resized. Each widget of a grid page must be assigned to one of the areas defined by the page layout. 

This way of organizing a page and the widgets on the page is supported by appropriate fuctionalities in the Page Manager. When opening the Page Manager two tabs are now available: the App tab and the Page tab. The App tab shows a list of all the pages in the application:
