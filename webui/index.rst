WebUI
*****

This manual is meant for app developers who want to build a Web-based User Interface (in short, WebUI) for their AIMMS applications. 
To a smaller extent, this manual may also prove itself to be useful as reference for the end users of such AIMMS WebUI apps, for example, when using configuration options available to them while running the WebUI applications on the AIMMS PRO platform (including the AIMMS Cloud).
