AIMMS Cloud Platform 
*********************

The AIMMS Cloud Platform is a fully managed AIMMS PRO environment. It is secure, highly reliable, up-to-date and always provides all the IT capacity you need, of course within the confines of your subscription of license. All you have to do is develop and publish your apps. We take care of all else. 

Most of the documentation of the `AIMMS PRO Platform <../pro/index.html>`_ is also relevant for the AIMMS Cloud Platform, more specifically:
 
* `Introduction to the AIMMS PRO Platform <../pro/intro.html>`_
* `The AIMMS PRO Configurator <../pro/configurator.html>`_
* `Server Administration <../pro/admin.html>`_
* `AIMMS PRO End-User Portal <../pro/portal.html>`_
* `Project Setup <../pro/project.html>`_
* `AIMMS PRO API <../pro/api.html>`_

This chapter discusses the topics where the configuration and use of the AIMMS Cloud Platform differ from the AIMMS PRO Platform.
