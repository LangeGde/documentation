Starting with AIMMS PRO 2.17.1, this page is added to the 'Configuration' menu. It displays the details of all active data sessions and ability to terminate the data session in order to release a seat(license).

Please note that this functionality was already available through 'View details' link of the 'Cluster Setup' page under 'Monitoring' menu in AIMMS PRO versions lower than 2.17.1.

Seats Management
----------------

Starting with AIMMS PRO 2.23.0, this page is added back to the 'Configuration' menu. It displays detailed information about the usage of the client licenses and ability to 'Delete' reserved seats for WinUI apps. Client License sessions are counted per user per device combination, instead of per session meaning that one user can run multiple apps whilst only occupying one session.
