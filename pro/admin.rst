Server Administration
*********************

After you have successfully installed AIMMS PRO 2.0, you can open the portal to perform administrative tasks. By default, the portal can be reached at the URL *http://<host>:8080*. To perform administrative tasks, you can log in using the administrative account 'admin' within the ROOT environment. Upon installation, the admin account is delivered with the default password *admin*. You are advised to change this password as soon as possible, which can be done by clicking on the admin@ROOT menu on the top right of the screen, and selecting 'Account settings' from the menu that pops down.
