Installation
************

As AIMMS PRO will become a central resource in your organization, it is essential that both first time installations and upgrades of AIMMS PRO are well planned, controlled, and successful. That is why we, at AIMMS, are more than willing to assist in this process; please contact our support staff for first time AIMMS PRO installations or upgrades of AIMMS PRO.  In addition, please check that the `system requirements <system-requirements.html>`_ are met and that the AIMMS License server is installed.
 
You will also need to install the `AIMMS License Server <license-server.html>`_. After these steps, you may proceed with the `installation <install-windows.html>`_ and the `configuration <configurator.html>`_ of the AIMMS PRO server.
