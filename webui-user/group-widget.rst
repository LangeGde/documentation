Group Widget
------------

The Group widget allows you to group a number of widgets together. This way you can easily create form-like structures or simply keep two or more widgets together. It is not intended to be a replacement for page layout.

To add and remove widgets, the Group widget has the concept of “edit mode”. When you press the “edit group” button, the available areas will get a darker background and will show a “plus” sign. By clicking on one of these areas, you can add a widget, just like on a page.

The Group widget comes with a number of templates. These provide you with various options with secondary content aligned to the left, right, top or bottom of your main widget. These templates provide different areas in which you can add widgets. Each template has a main area and one or more secondary areas. These secondary areas always have a fixed width or height, while the main area sizes to the available space. The ideal configuration for a Group widget is thus to have your main widget, such as a chart or table, in the main area, and secondary widgets, such as selection widgets or buttons, in the secondary areas.

When in edit mode, you can add widgets, or remove them by dragging them onto the top bar (where it says “drag widgets here to delete”). Currently, you cannot drag widgets from one area to another, or outside of/into the Group widget. This might change in the future. You can get out of edit mode by clicking the “edit group” button again, or by pressing the “x” in the top right corner of the edit bar. Not all widgets are suitable to be placed in all template areas. For now, the Group widget does not take this into account (note: in the future we will prevent the Group widget from showing widgets in areas that do not support them).
