Page Menu
*********

The Page Menu (available in AIMMS 4.40+) that is visible in the `Menu Bar <menu-bar.html>`_ contains all the pages that a user currently has access to. The Page Menu allows the WebUI app-users to navigate through the available pages.

The developer of a WebUI app can create a page tree by using the *Page Manager*, which determines the content of the Page Menu.

* By clicking on the page names, you can visit the pages. 
* Little triangles indicate that there are subpages available. By hovering over the parent page name, the subtree will appear.
