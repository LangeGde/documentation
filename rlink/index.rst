RLink Library
*****************

AIMMS RLink is a way to allow AIMMS to execute user specified R code and pass data between AIMMS and the R runtime environment. R is a language and environment for statistical computing with a rich library ecosystem. RLink allows us to extend AIMMS optimization capabilities with the possibilities of R.

This manual is written for:

* AIMMS developers who are using R functionalities in AIMMS projects. 
* IT support who needs to install necessary files in the server or user machine.

.. important::

    The beta version of R-Link has been made available in the past for testing. This older version is deprecated and will no longer be supported. The current version is a complete rewrite and uses DataLink for passing data between AIMMS and R.
